Go to [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/gallery).

Renderings of the phylogenetic trees generated in this project, including:

- An [**interactive visualization**](../empress.html), powered by our novel massive tree renderer: [Empress](https://github.com/biocore/empress).

- Pre-formated tree and metadata files which can be directly parsed and rendered by [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/) and [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). They were pre-collapsed at given taxonomic ranks (using either NCBI or GTDB taxonomy).

- High-resolution PDF images of selected trees.

- We also provide the [protocol](../protocols/tree_rendering.md) and [source code](../code/notebooks/render_tree.ipynb) for generating and using the static renderings.
