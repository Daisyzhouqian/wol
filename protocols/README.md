Protocols
=========

Protocols for building, analyzing, and using the trees and other resources in this project.


Building
--------

- [**Genome sampling**](genomes): Select _n_ genomes form a genome pool such that it maximizes biodiversity as represented by the _k_-mer signature of genomes.

- [**Taxon subsampling**](taxon_subsampling): Select _n_ taxa from a larger phylogenetic tree such that it maximizes representation of deep-branching, large clades.


Observation
-----------

- [**Tree rendering**](tree_rendering): Collapse tree at given rank(s) and generate files ready for iTOL and FigTree rendering.


Usage
-----

For QIIME users
