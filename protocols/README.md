Protocols
=========

Protocols for building, analyzing, and using the trees and other resources in this project.

Tree building
-------------

- [**Genome sampling**](genomes): Select _n_ genomes form a genome pool such that it maximizes biodiversity as represented by the _k_-mer signature of genomes.

- [**Taxon subsampling**](taxon_subsampling): Select _n_ taxa from a larger phylogenetic tree such that it maximizes representation of deep-branching, large clades.
