# Gene trees

Tree of individual marker genes were reconstructed using [RAxML](https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/index.html) under the CAT model, with the optimal amino-acid substitution model selected per gene. Branch lengths were further optimized using either RAxML or [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) (if RAxML cannot complete) under the Gamma model.

Note that each of the trees typically contains a large proportion, but not all, of the 10,575 taxa, due to the absence or undetectability of the gene in the corresponding genome. The domains Bacteria and Archaea are not always perfectly separated, either. They are presented in the unrooted form.
