# Trees of 1,000 taxa

The original 10,575 genomes were subsampled to 1,000 that best represent deep-branching, large clades according to the ASTRAL tree. On this subsampled taxon set, more sites or more complex models can be used for phylogenetic inference.

- [**al1k**](al1k): Tree using all sites with less than 50% gaps.

- [**pmsf**](pmsf): Trees using a site heterogeneous model.
