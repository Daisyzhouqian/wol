# taxdump

The NCBI taxonomy database, updated on March 7, 2017.

Retrieved from the NCBI FTP server, at:
- ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz

Shrinked so that it only contains taxonomy IDs of the 10,575 sampled genomes and their higher-level taxonomic groups.

- This was done using the script `shrink_taxdump.py`.
