# A Reference Phylogeny for 10,575 Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes

## Quick start guide

We recommend using [**tree.nwk**](data/trees/astral/branch_length/cons/collapsed/astral.cons.nid.e5p50.nwk) as the reference phylogeny for observations and downstream applications, together with the genome [**metadata**](data/genomes/metadata.tsv.bz2). This tree is identical to:

- `data/trees/astral/branch_length/cons/collapsed/astral.cons.nid.e5p50.nwk`

Multiple trees, built using different input data and methodology, together with the corresponding metadata, curated taxonomy and other information, are provided in this repository. Please browse the [**data**](data) directory for details.

The genome and protein sequences, multiple sequence alignments and other large data files are available at [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), with endpoint name [**WebOfLife**](https://www.globus.org/app/transfer?origin_id=23fd07dc-b6c8-11e8-8bf8-0a1d4c5c824a&origin_path=%2F) (owner: jdereus@globusid.org). For instruction on how to transfer files via Globus, please read this [guide](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/).
