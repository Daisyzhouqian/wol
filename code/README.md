The programs developed during the project are hosted in this project. Each program file contains instruction for users and/or developers. Use cases of individual programs are introduced in **Protocols** and **Application**.

- **scripts**: Python scripts

- **notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks

- **prototypeSelection**: Algorithms for "prototype selection", a statistical process that is central to the genome sampling process of this project.

Some utilities developed during this work are merged into the latest releases of [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/), an integrated Python package for bioinformatics.
